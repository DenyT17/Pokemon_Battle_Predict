## Description 
In this project i analyze and prepare pokemon dataset.I find pokemon with the best win ratio and with most number of wins.
I train model with the best with the greatest possible accuracy.At the end I make simple GUI to visualisation pokemon battle winner prediction.
I will reguraly upadte code and description. 

## Project stages

* Analisis pokemon dataset 

* Rescaling data

* Creating model with highest accuracy as possible

* Creating basic API to simulation pokemon battle

## DatasetüìÅ
Dataset used in this project you can find below this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/terminus7/pokemon-challenge)

## Project implementation description üîç
### Analysis
In this part, I analisis basic pokemon stats and put in to graph. Part of cod responsible is in ***analysis*** function. 
In addition, in this part, I fill in all the Nan values, and create a new DataFrames that contains the required information to train the model, such as:

* statistics of both pokemons (from the pokemon csv file) participating in the battle (from the combats.csv file),
* winner of every battle

This DataFrame is use to train model.

### Rescaling data and choosing classifier with the highest accuracy.
#### Rescaling data
In this part of project first i rescale dataset. Thanks to which accuracy may be higher and training model will be faster.
```python
for column in x_train.columns:
    ages_data = np.array(train[column]).reshape(-1, 1)
    x_train[column] = StandardScaler().fit_transform(ages_data)
```
***ScandarScaler()*** function standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
#### Choosing classifier with the highest accuracy.

In this case I create ***choose classifier*** function. This function return table with names and accuracy of chosen classifiers. 
```python
def choose_classifier(classifiers,poke_train_ftrs,poke_train_trg,poke_test_ftrs,poke_test_trg):
    rank = pd.DataFrame(columns=["Name","Accuracy"])
    i=0
    for classifier in classifiers:
        fit = classifier.fit(poke_train_ftrs, poke_train_trg)
        preds = fit.predict(poke_test_ftrs)
        name = classifier.__class__.__name__
        rank.loc[i,"Name"] = name
        rank.loc[i,"Accuracy"] = metrics.accuracy_score(poke_test_trg, preds)
        i+=1
    rank = rank.sort_values(by="Accuracy",ascending=False).reset_index(drop=True)
    print(tabulate(rank, headers = 'keys', tablefmt = "rounded_outline"))
```

According this information I choose _RandomForestClassifier_.

## Next goals üèÜ‚åõ
* Create GUI
* Try different classifiers and choose the best one
* Cross validation and Feature enginering to increase accuracy
