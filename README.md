## Description 
In this project i analyze and prepare pokemon dataset.I find pokemon with the best win ratio and with most number of wins.
I train model with the best with the greatest possible accuracy.At the end I make simple GUI to visualisation pokemon battle winner prediction.
I will reguraly upadte code and description. 

## Project stages

* Analisis pokemon dataset 

* Rescaling data

* Creating model with highest accuracy as possible

* Creating basic API to simulation pokemon battle

## DatasetüìÅ
Dataset used in this project you can find below this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/terminus7/pokemon-challenge)

## Project implementation description üîç
### Analysis
In this part, I analisis basic pokemon stats and put in to graph. Part of cod responsible is in ***analysis*** function. 
In addition, in this part, I fill in all the Nan values, and create a new DataFrames that contains the required information to train the model, such as:

* statistics of both pokemons (from the pokemon csv file) participating in the battle (from the combats.csv file),
* winner of every battle

This DataFrame is use to train model.

#### Pokemon type encoding and checking the effect.

Every pokemon has a type. Pokemon Type may be important, because for example water pokemon have higher chance to win against fire pokemon than against rock pokemon.
So I decide to take into consideration pokemon first type. For these reason I must encode pokemon type in to number. I will use two ways to do this and compare the results.

* Using pandas ***get_dummies*** method
Result of using this method is creation of new columns, one for every type in first and second pokemon. 
In the column that describes the type of a given pokemon appears 1 and in the others 0. Example result:

* Using sklearn ***LabelEncoder*** method
Result of using this method is changing every pokemon type to the corresponding number. Example result:Example result:

Second method giving better accuracy, so i choose it. 
 
### Rescaling data and choosing classifier with the highest accuracy.
#### Rescaling data
In this part of project first i rescale dataset. Thanks to which accuracy may be higher and training model will be faster.
```python
for column in x_train.columns:
    ages_data = np.array(train[column]).reshape(-1, 1)
    x_train[column] = StandardScaler().fit_transform(ages_data)
```
***ScandarScaler()*** function standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.

The part of code suscped for rescaling and encoding data is in ***enc_resc*** function. 

#### Choosing classifier with the highest accuracy.

In this case I create ***choose classifier*** function. This function return table with names and accuracy of chosen classifiers. 
To finally select the classifier, cross-validation will be used. The part of the code responsible for this operation is in ***choose_classifier*** function.

```python
def choose_classifier(classifiers,poke_train_ftrs,poke_train_trg,poke_test_ftrs,poke_test_trg):
    rank = pd.DataFrame(columns=["Name","Accuracy","Average CV Score"])
    i=0
    for classifier in classifiers:
        fit = classifier.fit(poke_train_ftrs, poke_train_trg)
        preds = fit.predict(poke_test_ftrs)
        name = classifier.__class__.__name__
        scores = cross_val_score(classifier,poke_train_ftrs, poke_train_trg, cv=5)
        rank.loc[i,"Name"] = name
        rank.loc[i,"Accuracy"] = metrics.accuracy_score(poke_test_trg, preds)
        rank.loc[i,"Average CV Score"] = scores.mean()
        i+=1
    rank = rank.sort_values(by="Average CV Score",ascending=False).reset_index(drop=True)
    print(tabulate(rank, headers = 'keys', tablefmt = "rounded_outline"))
```

Results :

As you can see, Random Forest Classifier has the best accuracy from chosen models. Thanks to this information, I can use this model for next steps in my project. 

The trained model is in the files under the name: _RandomForestClassifier.joblib_

## Downloading pokemon pictures using web scraping

Because in my GUI i want to use images showing selected pokemon i must gain pokemons images. 
For this, I create a new file  ***img_download.py***. I will fownload images from [this page](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/all))
Thanks to this I have folder with pokemon images, kt√≥re posiadajƒÖ nazwy kompatybilne z tymi w pliku pokemon.csv.


I manually downloaded pictures for the following pokemons:
-Farfetch'd, 
-Mr. Mime, 
-DeoxysAttack Forme, 
-Mime Jr., 
-Giratina Altered Forme, 
-Giratina Origin Forme, 
-Shaymin Land Forme, 
-Shaymin Sky Forme, 
-Flab√©b√©
