## Description 
In this project i analyze and prepare pokemon dataset.I find pokemon with the best win ratio and with most number of wins.
I train model with the best with the greatest possible accuracy.At the end I make simple GUI to visualisation pokemon battle winner prediction.
I will reguraly upadte code and description. 

## Project stages

* Analisis pokemon dataset 

* Rescaling data

* Creating model with highest accuracy as possible

* Creating basic API to simulation pokemon battle

## DatasetüìÅ
Dataset used in this project you can find below this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/terminus7/pokemon-challenge)

## Project implementation description üîç
### Analysis
In this part, I analisis basic pokemon stats and put in to graph. Part of cod responsible is in ***analysis*** function. 
In addition, in this part, I fill in all the Nan values, and create a new DataFrames that contains the required information to train the model, such as:

* statistics of both pokemons (from the pokemon csv file) participating in the battle (from the combats.csv file),
* winner of every battle

This DataFrame is use to train model.

#### Pokemon type encoding and checking the effect.

Every pokemon has a type. Pokemon Type may be important, because for example water pokemon have higher chance to win against fire pokemon than against rock pokemon.
So I decide to take into consideration pokemon first type. For these reason I must encode pokemon type in to number. I will use two ways to do this and compare the results.

* Using pandas ***get_dummies*** method
Result of using this method is creation of new columns, one for every type in first and second pokemon. 
In the column that describes the type of a given pokemon appears 1 and in the others 0. Example result:

* Using sklearn ***LabelEncoder*** method
Result of using this method is changing every pokemon type to the corresponding number. Example result:Example result:

Second method giving better accuracy, so i choose it. 
 
### Rescaling data and choosing classifier with the highest accuracy.
#### Rescaling data
In this part of project first i rescale dataset. Thanks to which accuracy may be higher and training model will be faster.
```python
for column in x_train.columns:
    ages_data = np.array(train[column]).reshape(-1, 1)
    x_train[column] = StandardScaler().fit_transform(ages_data)
```
***ScandarScaler()*** function standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.

The part of code suscped for rescaling and encoding data is in ***enc_resc*** function. 

#### Choosing classifier with the highest accuracy.

In this case I create ***choose classifier*** function. This function return table with names and accuracy of chosen classifiers. 
To finally select the classifier, cross-validation will be used.
## Next goals üèÜ‚åõ
* Create GUI
* Try different classifiers and choose the best one
* Cross validation and Feature enginering to increase accuracy
